CAD Models
==========

A few designs of various cases and mounts used for different iterations of
hardware over the course of this project.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Note:** As of this writing (July 2024), none of these designs are relevant to
the recent generations of TotTag PCBs. For the last few years, the board has
been designed to fit in the OKW Minitec case, specifically the
[B9006856](https://www.okwenclosures.com/en/Minitec/B9006856.htm).
You will also need the plastic ring which sits between the two halves of the
case, e.g. [B9006782](https://www.okwenclosures.com/en/Minitec/B9006782.htm)
(n.b., color doesn't affect anything; our original order bought 30 cases and 5
each of B9006782-B9006888).

**If you will be opening and closing the cases often,** we had OKW install
metal receptacles in the posts for the screws in our larger order. This widens
the plastic post width slightly (the PCB does not rely on the screw posts for
alignment or mounting in either case, so this should not affect things
generally). The new posts accept a `M2,5` screw. The product number for our
final case is `B9006A30`, which I believe is an internal code for the
customization they did for our design, and not a publicly available model.
However, hopefully their sales team can look up the old design by this
reference for your order if-needed, and do the same modification.
