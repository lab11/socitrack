# Dashboard & Processing

## Dashboard

The TotTag dashboard is a GUI for interacting with the tags.

To bring up the dashboard:
```bash
python3 tottag.py
```

### Disconnected state
To discover the devices, click the scan button.

To schedule a new experiment for a group of devices, the devices have to be placed on chargers, otherwise they will not be discovered by scanning.

Once a deployment is scheduled, the schedule will be push to all devices.

### Connected state

Each device can be connected to individually.

In the connected state, any updates to the deployment only apply to the current connected device. 

To download the logs, the connected device  **needs to be on the charger**.

To view live ranging data, the connected device **should not be not on the charger**.

## Processing

### Statistics

```python
from processing import *

# load the logs
A = load_data("E1.pkl")
B = load_data("Pat.pkl")
C = load_data("SB.pkl")

# 3.0 is the touching distance threshold (could be modified)
# the unit could be 'ft' or 'm'
get_daily_ranging_statistics(A, ["Pat","SB"], 3.0, unit='ft')
get_daily_ranging_statistics(B, ["E1","SB"], 3.0, unit='ft')
get_daily_ranging_statistics(C, ["E1","Pat"], 3.0, unit='ft')
```

### Plots
```python
from processing import *
A = load_data("07.pkl")
B = load_data("09.pkl")

# plot the voltages
get_voltage_time_series(A, "07")
get_voltage_time_series(B, "09")

# plot the ranges
get_ranging_time_series(A, "07","09")
get_ranging_time_series(B, "09","07")

get_motion_time_series(A, "07")
get_motion_time_series(B, "09")
```


### Visualizing paired logs with alignment

To visualize events, an event log needs to be prepared. The event log have to follow the following format
 - A single line (no `ENTER`/`RETURN` within the line) per event.
 - For each line, always start with the Y-m-d H:i:s timestamp.

```
2024-04-01 08:33:11 SB enters the room. E1 is propped up on the window sill. Pat is laying flat on the table. 
2024-02-01 08:34:58 SB leaves the room. 
```

```python
from processing import *

# load the logs
A = load_data("E1.pkl")
B = load_data("Pat.pkl")
C = load_data("SB.pkl")

# visualize paired logs
visualize_ranging_pair_slider(A,B,"E1","Pat")
visualize_ranging_pair_slider(A,C,"E1","SB")
visualize_ranging_pair_slider(B,C,"Pat","SB")

# extract events from the event log
events  = extract_simple_event_log("annotation_pst.txt")

# visualize the events
visualize_ranging_pair_slider(A,B,"E1","Pat", events=events)
visualize_ranging_pair_slider(A,C,"E1","SB", events=events)
visualize_ranging_pair_slider(B,C,"Pat","SB", events=events)

# visualize the events within [start_timestamp, end_timestamp]
visualize_ranging_pair_slider(A,B,"E1","Pat", events=events, start_timestamp=1708619580, end_timestamp=1708623540)
visualize_ranging_pair_slider(A,C,"E1","SB", events=events, start_timestamp=1708619580, end_timestamp=1708623540)
visualize_ranging_pair_slider(B,C,"Pat","SB", events=events, start_timestamp=1708619580, end_timestamp=1708623540)
```
